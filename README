0. Provided Foundation Model is built, these are the directions
   for get 'lkvm' to boot a guest. I launch Foundation model in bridge
   mode so I can ssh to it.
  
	HOST Network setup
			br0 (IP used in /etc/exports) to nfs mount
                           \
                            \
                           tap0

   > Foundation_v8 --image ./linux-system.axf --network bridged --network-bridge=tap0

    # git clone https://github.com/penberg/linux-kvm.git
    > make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- defconfig
    > make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- menuconfig
      - save settings 
    # save settings, make sure virtualization is enabled
    > make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- Image

    > cd tools/kvm
    vi Makefile - comment out the GTK stuff like 'FLAGS_GTK3' and ifeq 
                  if you don't plan to use graphics, comment it out otherwise
                  you'll need multiarch arm64 build environment
    # make it static so you don't have to worry about rootfs environment 
    > make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE_aarch64-linux-gnu- lkvm-static

2 Building Guest Kernel
  > cp HOST_LKVM_CONFIG .config
    - The config file is very important it enable virtio and lkvm console
  > make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- menuconfig
    - save settings
  > make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- Image
  > cp Image to Foundation Model - where ever you will run lkvm

3 I use 'initrd.ext3' tiny root filesystem to boot quickly but you could
  use other images.

4. In foundation model run:

  ./lkvm-static run --kernel Image -d initrd.ext3 -m 512 --console virtio --params "earlyprintk=smh console=hvc0 rw root=/dev/vda"

  - adjust the variables as needed
